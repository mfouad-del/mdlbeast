Release: 2025-12-27 — Stable & Secure

Summary:
- Status: Updated, secure, and stable (deployment successful on https://zaco-backend.onrender.com)
- Date: 2025-12-27
- Tag: v2025.12.27-stable

Highlights:
- Backups: Added full project backup/restore (DB + uploads + settings) with R2 upload, retention, scheduler, AES/GPG encryption options, and admin UI. Added lightweight JSON backup/export & JSON restore (non-destructive upsert).
- Restore: Added both *Restore from R2* (admin) and *Restore from uploaded archive file* (tar.gz/.gpg/.enc) flows in admin UI.
- Database: Applied migrations through 12 (including `11_add_statement_column` and `12_create_backups_table`).
- Features: Added `statement` (البيان) field saved to DB and included in A4 exports.
- Attachments: Added attachment count, ability to append attachments after creation, and UI updates.
- Security & Stability: Implemented session/refresh token flow, endpoint hardening, tenant scoping, upload validation, and other fixes.
- UI: Arabic localization updates, stamps and PDF stamping responsive fixes, and admin backups UI polish.

Notes & Recommendations:
- The service is deployed and running; verify scheduled backups and restores on staging before relying on production restores.
- Ensure environment variables for backups are set: BACKUPS_ENABLED, CF_R2_* (credentials), BACKUP_ENCRYPTION/BACKUP_ENC_KEY (base64 32 bytes) or GPG recipient, and BACKUP_RETENTION_COUNT.
- A large DB dump artifact (`backup-remote.dump`) was temporarily used for testing — it is recommended to remove it from the repo history if not needed.
